## Objective
To leverage GitHub Copilot for Azure to streamline development processes and improve productivity.

## Duration
2-3 hours

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account and access to GitHub Copilot.
- [Latest Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)
- MCAP Azure subscription.

## Agenda


### 1. Exercise 1: Setting Up GitHub Copilot for Azure

**Objective**: Configure GitHub Copilot for Azure (Preview)
**Steps**:
  1. [Install Visual Studio Code's GitHub Copilot extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart)
  2. [**Install GitHub Copilot For Azure**](https://github.com/microsoft/GitHub-Copilot-for-Azure?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
  3. Test a few simple prompts
     - Learning about Azure and its resources
        @azure do static web apps support static ip addresses?
        @azure whatâ€™s the difference between ACA and AKS?
 

Getting information about your Azure resources
@Azure what is the URL for my webapp named [name]?
@Azure how many storage accounts do I have in eastus?

### 3. Exercise 2: Deploying a Web Application to Azure (45 minutes)
- **Objective**: Use GitHub Copilot to deploy a web application to Azure.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Create a New Project**: Initialize a new web application project (e.g., using Node.js or Python).
  2. **Generate Deployment Scripts**: Use GitHub Copilot to generate scripts for deploying the application to Azure App Service.
  3. **Deploy the Application**: Follow the generated scripts to deploy the application.
- **Outcome**: Participants will deploy a web application to Azure using GitHub Copilot.

### 4. Exercise 3: Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions (30 minutes)
- **Objective**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and GitHub Copilot.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: Push the web application project to a new GitHub repository.
  2. **Set Up GitHub Actions**: Use GitHub Copilot to create a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and deployment.
  3. **Test the Pipeline**: Make a code change and observe the CI/CD pipeline in action.
- **Outcome**: Participants will have a CI/CD pipeline set up for their web application.

### 5. Wrap-Up and Q&A (30 minutes)
- **Review**: Summarize key learnings and discuss challenges faced during the exercises.
- **Q&A**: Open floor for questions and feedback.
