- GitHub account and access to GitHub Copilot.
- [Latest Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)
- MCAP Azure subscription.

## Agenda


### 1. Exercise 1: Setting Up GitHub Copilot for Azure

####  **Objective**: 

  Configure GitHub Copilot for Azure (Preview) with Visual Code Insider

**Steps**:
  1. [Install Visual Studio Code's GitHub Copilot extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart)
  2. [Install GitHub Copilot For Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/GitHub-Copilot-for-Azure?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
  3. Invoke the @azure copilot extension by putting @azure before your query with a few simple prompts:
      - Learning about Azure and its resources        
        ```
        @azure do static web apps support static ip addresses?        
        ```   
      - Getting information about your Azure resources
        ```
        @azure what is the URL for my webapp named [name]?
        @azure how many storage accounts do I have in uksouth?
        ```

      More sample questions [here](https://github.com/microsoft/GitHub-Copilot-for-Azure?tab=readme-ov-file#sample-questions)

  4. You can find a shortcut to chat with @azure in the context menu for resources in the Azure Extensions: 
    
      - In Visual Studio Code Insiders, open the command pallete via <kbd>F1</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>, and run the command "Extensions: Install Extensions...",
    
      - Navigate to your resource and right click to use it in the context menu

### 3. Exercise 2: Deploying a Web Application with @azure
- **Objective**: Use GitHub Copilot @azure to deploy a web application to Azure.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Create a New Project**: Initialize a new web application project (e.g., using Node.js or Python).
 
- **Outcome**: Participants will deploy a web application to Azure using GitHub Copilot.

### 4. Exercise 3: Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions (30 minutes)
- **Objective**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and GitHub Copilot.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: Push the web application project to a new GitHub repository.
  2. **Set Up GitHub Actions**: Use GitHub Copilot to create a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and deployment.
  3. **Test the Pipeline**: Make a code change and observe the CI/CD pipeline in action.
- **Outcome**: Participants will have a CI/CD pipeline set up for their web application.

### 5. Wrap-Up and Q&A (30 minutes)
- **Review**: Summarize key learnings and discuss challenges faced during the exercises.
- **Q&A**: Open floor for questions and feedback.
